          <h2>Parent reviews</h2>
          <li>"Aundriell watched my 3 year old son pretty regularly for a few months. He really liked her and was always asking when he would get to see her again. She is very sweet and pretty reliable. Her schedule couldn't accommodate my needs anymore, which is the only reason she is not my regular sitter anymore. But, she has been very willing to provide back-up and last minute care if needed."</li>
          <li>"Aundriell has been professional since the beginning years of caring for my daughter in 2005. She is reliable and trustworthy. She has a true passion for children. Her undying loyally to me and my daughter has been a great support. She is always flexible with my schedule and I appreciate her for caring for my daughter like her own."</li>
          <li>"Anna was a good babysitter, she did everything I asked her to do and more. BUT I did not appreciate the way she spoke to my childer. She put on that classic, 'I'm speaking to a child so I have to change my voice in a very condesending way' voice."</li>
